# Highlight-Demo-App

This is a demo of the Highlight Runtime API. It's a simple app that shows you how to use the API to get an access token to authenticate your Highlight users on the backend.

## Development

To get started, run `pnpm dev`. This will start the Next.js app.

## Deploying

We recommend deploying through [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

You can view this deployed app at [https://highlight-demo-app.vercel.app/](https://highlight-demo-app.vercel.app/) or by adding the HL Demo app inside of Highlight.
